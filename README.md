# Diwali_Light_decoration_project

In this project I have used 5 relays out of 9 connected with the Arduino Pro mini 3.3v 8mhz, (You can use any Arduino with a bunch of transistors and relays to make this type of project for decoration.
It can also be used for automation with few modifications (A tutorial on those will come in the future).
there are 3 patterns (till now) in the code to run the light shown in the video here:- https://youtube.com/shorts/GVUkjkL6pTo?feature=share
you can add more as you want comments are added in the code to make it easily understandable.
